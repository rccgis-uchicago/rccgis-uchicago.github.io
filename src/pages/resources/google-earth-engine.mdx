# Google Earth Engine (GEE)

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud-based platform that revolutionizes geospatial analysis by combining a vast catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with powerful analytical capabilities. This tool has become essential for researchers, scientists, and students across various disciplines at the University of Chicago.

## Applications and Uses

GEE's versatility makes it invaluable for a wide range of research areas:

- **Environmental Science**: Monitor deforestation, assess climate change impacts, and analyze ecosystem dynamics.
- **Urban Studies**: Analyze urban growth patterns, land use changes, and city planning initiatives.
- **Agricultural Research**: Support crop monitoring, yield prediction, and agricultural land use assessment.
- **Disaster Management**: Aid in real-time monitoring of natural disasters, risk assessment, and recovery planning.
- **Climate Studies**: Study long-term climate trends and their effects on various Earth systems.
