# Getting Started


## GIS on High-Performance Computing at RCC

The Research Computing Center (RCC) at the University of Chicago provides comprehensive support for Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) on our high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. This integration empowers researchers to leverage HPC capabilities for complex spatial analyses, large-scale geospatial data processing, and cutting-edge GIS technologies.

### Available GIS Software

RCC supports a variety of GIS software platforms optimized for HPC environments:

- GRASS GIS
- QGIS
- Arcpy (available based on request)
- R with spatial packages (sp, sf, raster)
- Python with geospatial libraries (GeoPandas, Rasterio, Shapely)
- Orfeo Toolbox (OTB)
- SAGA GIS
- STATA
- SAS
- MATLAB

### HPC-Enabled GIS Capabilities

- **Big Data Processing**: Analyze large-scale geospatial datasets that exceed the capacity of desktop systems.
- **Parallel Computing**: Utilize multiple cores for faster processing of computationally intensive spatial analyses.
- **Remote Sensing**: Process and analyze satellite imagery and LiDAR data efficiently.
- **Spatial Statistics**: Perform complex geostatistical analyses on large datasets.
- **Machine Learning for GIS**: Implement advanced machine learning algorithms for geospatial applications.

## Advanced GIS Technologies

### GeoAI

GeoAI integrates artificial intelligence with geospatial data and analysis, revolutionizing the GIS industry. On RCC's HPC infrastructure, researchers can leverage GeoAI capabilities for:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify complex spatial patterns and relationships in large datasets.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Enhance forecasting accuracy using historical geospatial data.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Analyze streaming geospatial data for rapid detection of environmental changes.
- **Automated Feature Extraction**: Use machine learning algorithms to extract features from satellite imagery and LiDAR data.

Our HPC environment supports popular GeoAI frameworks and libraries, enabling researchers to develop and run sophisticated AI models on geospatial data at scale.

### CyberGIS

CyberGIS combines cyberinfrastructure capabilities with GIS to tackle computationally intensive spatial problems. RCC's HPC resources are well-suited for CyberGIS applications, offering:

- **Scalable Processing**: Handle very large spatial datasets and complex analytical software beyond the capabilities of desktop systems.
- **Collaborative Environment**: Enable multiple users to access CyberGIS capabilities and share resources.
- **Advanced Geospatial Tools**: Provide access to cutting-edge spatial analysis techniques optimized for high-performance environments.
- **Interdisciplinary Integration**: Facilitate the synthesis of geospatial approaches with other scientific domains.

## Accessing GIS on HPC

1. Request an RCC account if you don't already have one.
2. Connect to the RCC cluster via SSH or the web portal.
3. Load the required GIS modules using the `module load` command e.g. `module load qgis`.
4. Run your GIS workflows through batch jobs or interactive sessions.

## Training and Support

- **Workshops**: Regular training sessions on GIS in HPC environments, including specialized workshops on GeoAI and CyberGIS applications.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides on running GIS software on RCC systems.
- **Consultation**: One-on-one support for integrating GIS workflows with HPC and advanced GIS technologies.

## Data Management

- Access to shared geospatial datasets on RCC storage systems.
- Tools for efficient data transfer and management of large geospatial files.
- Integration with RCC's data management policies and best practices.
