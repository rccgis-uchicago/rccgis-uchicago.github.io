## ArcGIS Desktop Service Level/Rate

In line with recent changes made by ESRI, UChicago is transitioning to a modern GIS pattern, embracing ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Pro, and various ArcGIS Apps. This update introduces a named user licensing model, which will be the standard method for accessing the suite of ArcGIS web, mobile, and desktop applications.

### Important Changes

- **ArcMap Discontinuation:** ArcMap is no longer available. Transition to ArcGIS Pro, which is now the primary software for GIS tasks.
- **Named User Licensing:** The named user license is the only method to authorize ArcGIS going forward, aligning with ESRI's strategy to streamline access and enhance security.
- **SAML Logins for Easy Access:** UChicago uses SAML login with CNetID for seamless access to ArcGIS on both lab environments and personal devices.

### Lab Environment Deployment

- ArcGIS Pro can be deployed in lab settings with shared computers. Licenses are managed through ArcGIS named user accounts.
- Collaborate with IT or lab managers to ensure proper logout procedures to prevent issues such as prolonged logins, shared logins, or unauthorized data access.

### Security and Privacy

- Avoid using a common username and password for logging into Windows on shared systems. Always use your individual credentials to protect your work and privacy.

### Reminder

- Single and concurrent user licenses are no longer offered by ESRI. The named user license is essential for all GIS software authorization.
- After June 30, 2024, new licenses for ArcMap will not be available. Academic users must transition to ArcGIS Pro to continue using Esri's GIS tools. See ESRI Migration Resources for more information.
