An interactive platform for analyzing spatial data related to cancer incidence and catchment areas. This tool enables researchers to assess cancer impacts within specific geographic locations, enhancing targeted healthcare resource allocation and intervention planning.

### Objectives
- Support data-driven decisions in healthcare
- Visualize cancer-related data spatially
- Analyze patterns across defined catchment areas
- Benefit public health professionals and researchers

## JCOIN Dashboard: Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network

### Overview
Part of the NIH HEAL Initiative, this project addresses the opioid crisis by providing a spatial view of opioid use disorder (OUD) resources across justice-involved populations. The dashboard maps federal grants to states and cities, enabling comprehensive analysis of OUD interventions.

### Key Features
- Interactive mapping of OUD resources
- Federal grant distribution visualization
- Spatial analysis tools for policy development
- Integration of justice and healthcare data

### Impact
The JCOIN Dashboard serves as a crucial tool for:
- Policy makers tracking intervention effectiveness
- Researchers studying OUD patterns
- Practitioners coordinating resources
- Government agencies allocating funding
