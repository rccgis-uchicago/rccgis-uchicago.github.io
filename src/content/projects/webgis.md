The RCC’s application development team partners with researchers to design, build, and maintain custom WebGIS and spatial data platforms. Our solutions support interactive mapping, complex data integration, and advanced visualization for a wide range of scientific and medical research needs.

We collaborate with labs and research groups to translate innovative concepts into robust, sustainable software solutions that can support grant proposals and peer-reviewed publications.

## Our Process and Capabilities
We provide end-to-end development support, from initial concept validation to long-term maintenance. Our technical expertise includes:

- **Full-Stack Application Development:** Building interactive platforms using robust back-end and front-end technologies (e.g., Python/Django, JavaScript/React).
- **Analytical & Visualization Tools:** Creating initial prototypes and full applications with data-focused languages and frameworks (e.g., R/Shiny).
- **Custom WebGIS & Spatial Analysis:** Developing tailored Geographic Information Systems for spatial data management, visualization, and analysis.
- **Research Data Management:** Architecting systems for secure data storage, processing, and reporting.
- **Legacy System Modernization:** Transitioning existing research tools to more scalable and maintainable technology stacks.

## Selected Projects

### ICAT: Innovative Computational Analysis Toolkit
ICAT demonstrates our process of maturing a novel research method into a production-grade platform. The project began with an R/Shiny application that proved the core methodology, which was subsequently published in Nature (March 2024). Following this academic validation, we redeveloped the tool into a scalable and user-friendly production system using Django and React, with an ongoing roadmap for future feature enhancements.

Technologies: R/Shiny (v1.0), Django/React (v2.0)

### JCOIN
#### Justice Community Opioid Innovation Network Geospatial Platform
For the NIH HEAL Initiative, we developed a spatial data platform to support research on the opioid crisis. The JCOIN dashboard provides an interactive view of opioid use disorder (OUD) resources and federal grant distribution, integrating justice and healthcare data. The tool serves researchers, policymakers, and healthcare providers in analyzing intervention effectiveness and identifying service gaps.

Expertise: WebGIS, Data Integration, Spatial Analysis
