## What is GeoAI?

Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) is an interdisciplinary field that combines geospatial science, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) to analyze and interpret spatial data. At RCC GIS, we leverage big data, high-performance computing, and advanced algorithms to address complex geospatial challenges across various domains.

## Our GeoAI Capabilities

### Deep Learning for Spatial Analysis
We utilize advanced neural network architectures, including:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image analysis
- Graph Neural Networks for network and connectivity analysis
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for time-series geospatial data
- Transformer models for spatial-temporal predictions

### Explainable GeoAI (XGeoAI)
Our research focuses on developing transparent and interpretable AI models for geospatial applications, ensuring that decision-makers can understand and trust the results of our analyses.

### Generative AI for Geospatial Tasks
We explore the use of generative AI models, such as GeoGPT, for various applications:
- Map enrichment and feature extraction
- Synthetic data generation for training
- Spatiotemporal predictions and simulations

### Integration with Big Data
Our GeoAI solutions are designed to handle large-scale spatial and temporal datasets, enabling high-resolution modeling and analysis for:
- Environmental epidemiology
- Exposure modeling
- Disease surveillance
- Urban dynamics

## Featured Projects

### Urban Resilience and Climate Adaptation
We use GeoAI to predict and manage urban resilience against extreme weather events, assess climate risks, and support disaster response planning. Our models help cities prepare for and adapt to climate change impacts.

### Public Health and Epidemiology
Our GeoAI models analyze spatial and temporal data for:
- Disease mapping and hotspot detection
- Exposure modeling for environmental health
- Healthcare accessibility analysis
- Pandemic response planning

### Environmental Monitoring
We leverage AI and machine learning techniques to analyze remote sensing data for:
- Deforestation monitoring and prediction
- Ocean eddy tracking
- Air quality assessment
- Land use/land cover change detection
