# Basics of GIS

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are powerful tools for capturing, storing, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data. Here are some fundamental concepts:

## Raster Data
Rasters are regularly gridded datasets like GeoTIFFs, JPGs, and PNGs. In GIS, rasters are used for representing continuous phenomena such as:
- Elevation
- Rainfall
- Temperature
- Land cover
- Satellite imagery

## Vector Data
Vector data represents discrete features using points, lines, and polygons. Common vector data types include:
- Points: Cities, trees, wells
- Lines: Roads, rivers, contours
- Polygons: Administrative boundaries, lakes, parcels
