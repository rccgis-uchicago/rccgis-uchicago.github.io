# Satellite Imagery Resources

Satellite imagery is a crucial data source for many GIS applications. The University of Chicago's Research Computing Center (RCC) provides access to various imagery sources for academic researchers.

## Available Imagery Sources

- **ASTER Global DEM Data**: High-resolution global digital elevation models
- **Digital Globe Satellite Imagery**: High-resolution commercial satellite imagery
- **ESA Global Land Cover**: Land cover classification data from the European Space Agency
- **Planet**: Daily Earth imaging via small satellites
- **USGS Earth Explorer**: Comprehensive archive of satellite imagery and aerial photography

## Applications in GIS

### Common Applications
- Land use and land cover mapping
- Urban planning and development monitoring
- Agricultural yield estimation
- Disaster response and damage assessment
- Environmental monitoring
- Climate change studies

### Key Considerations
- Spatial resolution
- Spectral resolution
- Temporal resolution
- Atmospheric corrections
- Image classification techniques
