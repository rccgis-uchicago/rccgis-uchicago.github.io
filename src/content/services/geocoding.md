## **Comprehensive Geocoding Infrastructure and Strategy (v2.2)**

**Key Update:** This version has been enhanced with a new section providing implementation examples for R users via the `arcgisgeocode` package, making the programmatic workflow more accessible.

### **Executive Summary**

To address the diverse and growing geospatial research needs at the University, a robust, flexible, and cost-effective geocoding strategy is essential. This document outlines a hybrid geocoding architecture that leverages the strengths of a self-hosted open-source solution, direct commercial API access, and a user-friendly web application. By combining a containerized OpenStreetMap (OSM) Nominatim instance, the Google Maps and Esri ArcGIS World Geocoder APIs, and the **RCC-GIS Geocoding Service**, this strategy provides multiple pathways to handle varying requirements for accuracy, volume, cost, and data privacy.

This document outlines two primary workflows:

1.  A **programmatic hybrid approach** for automated, large-scale, or customized tasks, with examples in Python and R.
2.  A **web-based service** for easy-to-use batch geocoding via a graphical interface.

### **1. Geocoding Service Comparison (2025)**

The following table provides an updated comparison of the available geocoding services, including performance metrics and rate limits.

| Service | Type | Accuracy & Coverage | Rate Limit | Cost Structure (Subject to Change) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RCC-GIS Geocoding Service** | Web Application (Esri Backend) | **Match Rate:** 82.3% <br> **Rooftop Accuracy:** 80.1% | ~250-500k records/hr | **Free:** Credit-based. 2000 free credits per user (equals 50,000 records). More by request. |
| **OpenStreetMap Nominatim** | Open Source (Self-Hosted) | **Match Rate:** Varies by region <br> **Coverage:** Global (quality is region-dependent) | Configurable | **Free Software:** Infrastructure and maintenance costs only. |
| **Google Maps API** | Commercial Cloud (Direct API) | **Match Rate:** 85.7% <br> **Rooftop Accuracy:** 83.8% <br> **Coverage:** Global | ~50 QPS | **Free Tier:** 10,000 requests/month <br> **Standard:** ~$5/1,000 requests |
| **Esri ArcGIS World Geocoder**| Commercial Cloud (Direct API) | **Match Rate:** 82.3% <br> **Rooftop Accuracy:** 80.1% <br> **Coverage:** Global + Premium <br> *(Note: R users can easily access this service via the `arcgisgeocode` package)*| ~5 QPS | **Free Tier:** 20,000 requests/month <br> **Standard:** ~$5/1,000 requests (40 credits) |
| **RCC Geocoder Toolkit** | Local Scripts | N/A | Local | Internal resource; no direct cost. |

### **2. Proposed Programmatic Hybrid Strategy**

This programmatic hybrid workflow is designed for automated, large-scale, and customized geocoding tasks. For simpler, UI-based batch processing using the Esri engine, users can also leverage the **RCC-GIS Geocoding Service** web application (see Section 7 for a detailed guide).

#### **Hybrid Workflow Architecture**

1.  **Preparation Layer (Mandatory):** All addresses **must** first be processed using the **RCC Geocoder Toolkit** (local cleaning scripts).
2.  **Primary Layer (Free & Private): Self-Hosted OSM Nominatim**
      * **Use for:** All initial batch processing and for any data classified as sensitive (PII, PHI).
3.  **Secondary Layer (Paid & High-Accuracy): Commercial APIs**
      * **Use for:** Addresses that failed on the primary OSM layer or require the highest possible accuracy. Fall back to **Google Maps API** or **Esri World Geocoder API**.

#### **Implementation Examples**

The following examples show how to implement parts of this workflow in common data science languages.

##### **Python Implementation (Pseudo-code)**

This function demonstrates the fallback logic of the hybrid approach.

```python
import time

def hybrid_geocode(address, threshold=0.8):
    """Attempts to geocode an address using a hybrid waterfall approach."""
    try:
        # Tier 1: Try self-hosted OSM Nominatim first
        osm_result = osm_geocode(address)
        if osm_result and osm_result.confidence > threshold:
            return osm_result
        
        # Tier 2: Fall back to Google Maps API
        google_result = google_geocode(address)
        return google_result

    except RateLimitError as e:
        # Implement backoff strategy
        time.sleep(30)
        return hybrid_geocode(address) 
    except Exception as e:
        return None
```

##### **R Implementation Example using `arcgisgeocode`**

For R users, the `arcgisgeocode` package provides a convenient interface to the Esri World Geocoder, which can be used as part of the secondary, high-accuracy layer of the hybrid workflow.

```r
# Install the necessary packages
# install.packages("arcgisgeocode")
# install.packages("arcgisutils") # For API key management

library(arcgisgeocode)
library(arcgisutils)
library(dplyr)

# Set your ArcGIS API key. This only needs to be done once per session.
# It is recommended to store keys as environment variables, not directly in scripts.
set_arc_api_key(Sys.getenv("ARCGIS_API_KEY"))

# --- Batch Geocoding a data frame ---

# Create a sample data frame of addresses
addresses_to_geocode <- data.frame(
  id = c(1, 2, 3),
  address = c(
    "5801 S Ellis Ave, Chicago, IL 60637",
    "1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500",
    "1 E 161st St, The Bronx, NY 10451"
  )
)

# Geocode the 'address' column
# The for_storage = TRUE parameter is required for batch geocoding and may consume credits
geocoded_results <- geocode_addresses(
  single_line = addresses_to_geocode$address,
  for_storage = TRUE 
)

# The result is a spatial data frame (sf object)
glimpse(geocoded_results)
```

### **3. Implementation Guide: Containerized OSM Nominatim**

#### **Resource Requirements**

| Component | Minimum Requirement | Recommended for Production |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RAM** | 12GB (for a single country/region) | 128GB (for North America or global dataset) |
| **Storage** | 500GB SSD | 1TB+ NVMe |
| **CPU** | 4 cores | 8+ cores |

#### **HPC Deployment on Midway (Apptainer)**

1.  **Optimized Container Build:**
    ```bash
    apptainer build nominatim.sif nominatim.def
    ```
2.  **PostgreSQL Performance Tuning:**
    ```ini
    shared_buffers = 2GB
    maintenance_work_mem = 10GB
    work_mem = 50MB
    synchronous_commit = off
    checkpoint_timeout = 60min
    ```
3.  **HPC Best Practices:**
      * **Utilize Local Scratch:** Set `export APPTAINER_TMPDIR=/tmp` before running I/O-intensive jobs.
      * **Use Fast Storage:** Host the Nominatim database on the fastest possible storage tier.

-----

### **4. Operational Best Practices for Programmatic Geocoding**

#### **Rate Limiting Management**

  * **Token Bucket Algorithm:** Implement a token bucket system in client applications to manage request bursts and stay within API limits.
  * **Manual Delays & Backoff:** For simpler scripts, add a manual delay (`time.sleep()` in Python, `Sys.sleep()` in R). Your code must handle `429` (Too Many Requests) errors by implementing an exponential backoff-and-retry strategy.

#### **Data Preparation**

  * **Clean and Standardize:** Use the RCC Geocoder Toolkit to parse, clean, and standardize addresses.
  * **Log Extensively:** Log which service geocoded each address, the confidence score, and the match type (`ROOFTOP`, `INTERPOLATED`, etc.).

-----

### **5. Cost Optimization by Volume (Programmatic Approach)**

  * **Low Volume (< 10k addresses/month):** Primarily use the **Google Maps API** free tier.
  * **Medium Volume (10k - 50k addresses/month):** Implement the full **hybrid approach**: process all data through OSM first, then use paid APIs for failures.
  * **High Volume (> 50k addresses/month):** Rely almost exclusively on the self-hosted **OSM** solution.

-----

### **6. Advanced Infrastructure: Service Redundancy**

  * **Environment Separation:** Maintain separate **development/staging** and **production** environments for the Nominatim service to test changes before deployment.
  * **Version Control:** Mirror all documentation and client-side code in a version-controlled repository (e.g., Git) for disaster recovery and collaboration.

### **7. User Guide: RCC-GIS Geocoding Service Web Application**

This section provides a detailed guide for using the user-friendly, browser-based geocoding application.

#### **Introduction**

The University of Chicago RCC-GIS Geocoding Service allows UChicago affiliates to take lists of street addresses or place names and convert them into latitude and longitude coordinates. The engine behind this service is the **Esri World Geocoder for ArcGIS**.

> **All users are allocated 2000 credits by default. 2000 credits will allow a user to geocode 50,000 records.** If a user needs more, a request must be forwarded by email to **gis-help@rcc.uchicago.edu**.

#### **1. Formatting Data for Processing**

Records must be formatted in a **CSV (comma-separated value)** file with **UTF-8** encoding. The following headers are acceptable: `ID`, `ADDRESS`, `NEIGHBORHOOD`, `CITY`, `SUBREGION`, `REGION` or `STATE` or `ST`, `POSTAL` or `ZIP` or `ZIPCODE`, `COUNTRYCODE`.

#### **2. Sign In and Execution Procedure**

1.  **Activate the service by navigating to [http://geocoder.rcc.uchicago.edu](http://geocoder.rcc.uchicago.edu/)**.
2.  Log on by clicking on **"Sign in with Enterprise Login"**.
3.  Enter the portal's URL **"uchicago.maps.arcgis.com"** and click Continue.
4.  Sign in by clicking on **UCHICAGO** and entering your CNetID username and password.
5.  Upload your CSV file by clicking **Select File**.
6.  Click the **Submit** button to begin geocoding.
7.  When completed, click the link to **Download the Geocoded File**.

#### **3. Interpreting Geocoding Output**

The downloaded output file will include your original data along with three new columns: `LATITUDE`, `LONGITUDE`, and `MATCH SCORE`.

> **Warning:** A low match score will still produce a coordinate pair, but it may be incorrectly placed. For example, an address that cannot be found may default to the center of the city. Any records with a low match score should be re-evaluated, validated with another geocoding service, or dropped from the dataset.
